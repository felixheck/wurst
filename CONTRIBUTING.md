## Issues

### Before creating an issue

Please try to determine if the issue is caused by an underlying library, and if so, create the issue there. Sometimes this is difficult to know. I only ask that you attempt to give a reasonable attempt to find out. Oftentimes the readme will have advice about where to go to create issues.

Try to follow these guidelines

- **Avoid creating issues for implementation help**. It's much better for discoverability, SEO, and semantics - to keep the issue tracker focused on bugs and feature requests - to ask implementation-related questions on [stackoverflow.com][so] or send a mail/tweet.
- **Investigate the issue**
- **Check the readme** - oftentimes you will find notes about creating issues, and where to go depending on the type of issue.
- Create the issue in the appropriate repository.

### Creating an issue

Please be as descriptive as possible when creating an issue. Give me the information I need to successfully answer your question or address your issue by answering the following in your issue:

- **version**: please note the version of wurst are you using
- **extensions, plugins, helpers, etc** : please list any extensions you're using
- **error messages**: please paste any error messages into the issue, or a [gist](https://gist.github.com/)

### Closing issues

The original poster or the maintainer's of wurst may close an issue at any time. Typically, but not exclusively, issues are closed when:

- The issue is resolved
- The project's maintainers have determined the issue is out of scope
- An issue is clearly a duplicate of another issue, in which case the duplicate issue will be linked.
- A discussion has clearly run its course
